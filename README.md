# ReplaceCollectionViewWithGrid
This example is for Xamarin UWP platform. The reason why I create this is because my app crashes when running in production and can't figure out why. 
This is a example when you can't use the CollectionView's &lt;GridItemsLayout> tag directly. You could reference this example to make your own customized view similar to the CollectionView api. I also made some comments in my code. You could uncomment the collection view in the code which will have the same display.
