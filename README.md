# ReplaceCollectionViewWithGrid
This is a example when you can't use the CollectionView's &lt;GridItemsLayout> tag under ItemsLayout directly. You could reference this example to make your own customized view similar to the CollectionView api. I also made some comments in the code. Please let me know if you have any question about this example.
This is for xamarin UWP platform.
